    <dir>
        <ol>
            <li><font color="black">More and better companies are coming for Campus Placement in 
                leading Institutes</font></li>
            <li><font color="black">Higher salaries are being offered for M.Tech as compared to 
                B.E.</font></li>
            <li><font color="black">M.Tech degree leads to specialization and furthering of 
                interest in a certain area which may lead to Ph.D</font></li>
            <li><font color="black">M.Tech degree is a must for those wishing to apply for 
                Faculty/Research positions in educational Institutes/R&amp;D centers.</font></li>
            <li><font color="black">Scholarship is paid during M.Tech, so no headache to parents 
                for financial requirements.</font></li>
            <li><font color="black">The M.Tech program is a 3 semester (18 months) program; so 
                get more time to work out career opportunities.</font></li>
            <li><font color="black">MOST IMPORTANTLY to get to be a part of any Nationally

    <p>
        <font color="black"><b>Examination Details:</b></font></p>
    <ol>
        <li><font color="black">The examination is a single paper of 3 hours duration and 
            generally consists of Section A (Objective Type) which is of 75 marks and 
            Section B (Problem Type) which is of 75 marks. Total: 150 marks.</font></li>
        <li><font color="black">You have to opt for your subject and study as per the 
            syllabus mentioned in the GATE brochure (available in the Library).</font></li>
        <li><font color="black">The subjects of our interest are Computer Science and 
            Engineering, Electronics &amp; Communication Engineering., Electrical Engineering 
            and Instrumentation Engineering. Other subjects are also available such as 
            Mathematics, Physics, etc (consult the GATE brochure).</font></li>
        <li><font color="black">Generally a large number of students appear for the Computer 
            Science subject in order to do a M.Tech in Computer Science.</font></li>
        <li><font color="black">Old question papers are available in the shops.</font></li>
        <li><font color="black">Results of qualified candidates in GATE will give All India 
            Rank and indicate percentile score. For example, a percentile score of 99 means 
            you are in the top 1% category of the candidates who appeared for GATE.</font></li>
        <li><font color="black">Candidates who get less than 70 percentile get no score 
            card.</font></li>
        <li><font color="black">GATE scores are valid for 2 years. You may reappear the GATE 
            exam if you are not satisfied with the earlier score and the new score (if 
            better than the old one) will be used for admission purposes.</font></li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        <font color="black"><b>After the Exam, what next:</b></font></p>
    <ol>
        <li><font color="black">After publication of GATE results, students must apply to 
            individual Institutes to get their application forms.</font></li>
        <li><font color="black">Institutes advertise M.Tech admissions in leading newspapers 
            from 1<sup>st</sup><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>April till end 
            July. However some Institutes do not advertise and therefore students have to 
            get the forms themselves.</font></li>
        <li><font color="black">In the application forms, you have to mention your GATE 
            score alongwith other details.</font></li>
        <li><font color="black">The concerned Institute may conduct written test and/or 
            interview for the purpose of admission.</font></li>
        <li><font color="black">General thumb rules: If your Gate score in Computer Science 
            is 96 percentile or more then you can try for IITs, if between 85 - 96 
            percentile, then apply for top RECs, JADAVPUR, SHIBPUR, ROORKEE, etc. If less 
            than 85, you have to look for appropriate institutes.</font></li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        <font color="black"><b>Scholarship:</b></font></p>
    <p>
        <font color="black">During the pursuit of M.Tech, you are paid a scholarship of 
        Rs. 5000.00 per month by the Government of India. This amount is enough for 
        living expenses including purchase of books, etc. The scholarship is paid for 
        the entire 18 months M.Tech period.</font></p>
    <p>
        <font color="black"><b>SPECIAL:</b></font></p>
    <p>
        <font color="black">I encourage 3<sup>rd</sup><span 
            class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>year students to also appear GATE 
        alongwith Final Year students since:</font></p>
    <ol type="a">
