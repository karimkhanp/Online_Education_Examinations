        The Graduate Record Examination is a Standardized test that measures verbal, 
        mathematical and analytical skills. It is intended to help the graduate schools 
        (of all fields other than business) assess the potential of applicants for 
        advanced study . Nearly 2300 universities in the US require GRE®<span 
            class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>scores from each applicant. The GRE 
        tests the fundamental skills - Reasoning and Comprehension included - and does 
        not require any subject-specific theoretical study. (This is true only for the 
        General GRE Test, and not the GRE Subject, which 
        is required by certain universities. In this section, we mean the General GRE 
        Test whenever we refer to the GRE Test)</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; ">
        The test is designed in such a way that it would be unlike any other test you 
        would have taken at school or college. First, the test has no question paper or 
        answer sheets, nor does it have the same set of questions for all the examinees. 
        Further, it does not give you the option of not answering a question (unless, of 
        course, you run out of time at the end). All this because the GRE Test is an 
        entirely Computer based test - the keyboard and mouse do the work of a pen or 
        pencil. The test is scored out of 1600 (in multiples of 10).</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; ">
        The GRE Test is only one of several parameters which the graduate schools look 
        at to determine the selection of an applicant. A high score alone does not 
        translate into an admission offer from a great school. But the test can be 
        looked upon as the first major hurdle to be cleared in the process of getting 
        admission into a Graduate school of your choice.</p>

        The GRE Test is developed and administered by the US-based &quot;Educational Testing 
        Service&quot; (ETS) under the direction of the Graduate Record Examination Board , a 
        non-profit organization of graduate business schools worldwide. This implies 
        that ETS sets the questions, conducts the test, and sends each examinee the 
        score report. For the conduct of the test, ETS has appointed Testing Agencies in 
        various countries, which act as franchisee for ETS. In India, this agency is the 
        &quot;Sylvan Testing Services Pvt Ltd&quot; which administers the test at 9 centres in the 
        country:<b>Ahmedabad, Allahabad, Bangalore, Calcutta, Chennai, Hyderabad, 
        Mumbai, New Delhi, and Trivandrum.</b></p>

        All-round-the-year. Unlike other exams, you can choose your own date and time 
        for taking the GRE Test! The test is administered in the above cities 
        five-days-a-week (Monday through Friday), twice-a-day. September to December is 
        the high season for GRE Test, so in case you intend to take the test during this 
        period, you need to register very early (say 90 days in advance) to get a date 
        of your choice. Otherwise, registering at least 15 days in advance is mandatory. 
        The test lasts roughly three-and-a-half hours, and most centres offer two slots 
        : 9 A.M. and 2 P.M.</p>

        Anyone and everyone is eligible for taking the GRE Test - there are no 
        restrictions based on age or qualifications. The test scores are valid for five 
        years, i.e., most universities accept scores up to five years old. But it is 
        always better if your scores are recent (not older than 2 years).</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; ">
        Test fees for GRE Test may vary according to the country in which you take the 
        test. In India, this fee is US $140 (approx Rs. 7000), payable at the time of 
        registration.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><b>You cannot pay in 
        Indian Rupees.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>The fees has to be 
        paid through a US Dollar denominated draft, made out in favour of &quot;ETS - GRE&quot; 
        payable in the U.S. Such a draft is usually available with the Main Branches of 
        most banks (which have a foreign exchange counter) in most of the big cities for 
        a nominal charge (around Rs. 200). Alternately, the payment can also be made 
        through a credit card which has global acceptance. The credit card need not 
        necessarily be yours - you can get your father to sign for you!</p>

        <b><i>What is a Computer-Adaptive Test?</i></b></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; ">
        In a computer-adaptive test, the computer screen displays one question at a 
        time, which is chosen from a very large pool of questions categorized by content 
        and difficulty. The first question is always of a medium difficulty, and each 
        subsequent question is determined by your responses to all the previous 
        questions. In other words, the CAT adjusts itself to your ability level - you’ll 
        get few questions that are either too easy or too difficult for you.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; ">
        Each question in the GRE CAT has five answer options, and you are required to 
        select one of these five as the correct answer by clicking on it. A subsequent 
        question is displayed on the screen only after you have answered the previous 
        question, so you cannot skip a question. You cannot also go back to a previously 
        answered question to change your answer. Thus, if you guess a correct answer or 
        answer a question incorrectly by mistake, your answers to subsequent questions 
        will lead you back to questions that are at the appropriate level of difficulty 
        for you.</p>

        The test has three distinct sections : Writing Assessment (WA), Quantitative, 
        and Verbal. The Quantitative section has Problem Solving questions, which test 
        your mathematical skills and concepts of roughly the high-school level. The 
        Verbal Section has four types of questions : Antonyms, Analogies, Reading 
        Comprehension, and Sentence Completion. The questions of each type appear in no 
        set sequence. There are a total of 58 questions, 28 in Quantitative and 30 in 
        Verbal.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; ">
        The third section, Analytical Writing Assessment measures critical thinking and 
        analytical writing skills. It consists of two analytical writing tasks : (1) 
        &quot;Present your perspective on an issue&quot;, and (2) &quot;Analyze an Argument&quot;.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; ">
        There is a one-minute break between each test section. Midway through the 
        testing session, an on-screen message will inform you of the opportunity to take 
        a 10-minute break. Section timing will not stop if you take an unscheduled 
        break.</p>

        The verbal section in GRE Test requires a good vocabulary level, the basic 
        skills of correct English coupled with reasoning and analysis. The 30 questions, 
        to be attempted in 30 minutes, consist of four types : Antonyms, Analogies, 
        Sentence Completion, and Reading Comprehension. The four types are intermingled, 
        with no fixed number for each type.</p>

        The&nbsp; writing assessment section requires you to write - or type - two short 
        essays. The first is the Issue task, in which you need to analyze the issue 
        presented and explain your views on it. For the Issue task, you will be able to 
        choose 1 of 2 essay topics selected by the computer from the pool of topics. You 
        will get 45 minutes to do write or type this essay.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; ">
        The second essay is Analysis of an Argument, in which a given argument has to be 
        critically analyzed and evaluated. The Argument task does not offer a choice of 
        topics; the computer will present you with a single topic selected from the 
        topic pool. You will get 30 minutes to write or type this essay.<span 
            class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br />
        <br />
        For both the essays, the emphasis is on the &quot;Analytical&quot; part, and not on the 
        &quot;Writing&quot; part. This implies that a concise essay with well-reasoned points 
        written in simple English will be looked upon more favourably than an essay 
        which falls short on the analytical aspects even though it is high on writing 
        skills.<br />
        <br />
        A ten-minute break follows the two essays. The computer gives you the option to 
        take this break, or to move directly to the subsequent section. Even if you 
        finish the essays before the stipulated sixty minutes, the break will still be 
        of five minutes. It is advisable to utilize this break by gearing yourself up 
        for the tougher sections that follow.</p>

        ETS has the provision of reporting your GRE scores to a maximum of four 
        universities of your choice, the cost of which is built into the fee you pay. 
        You have to indicate the four universities where you wish a copy of your GRE 
        score to be sent after you get to know your scores. For reporting to each 
        additional university, the ETS charges you $13, payable by an international 
        credit card or a dollar denominated draft.</p>

        The GRE Test results comprise four different scores : a total score, and 
        separate scores for Verbal, Quantitative, and Analytical Writing Assessment 
        sections. The total score is reported out of 1600 and the sectional scores are 
        out of 800. The Writing Assessment section is scored separately on 6.<br />
        <br />
        In addition to these scores, the score report also contains percents (%) below. 
        These &quot;% below&quot; indicate the percentage of examinees who scored below you based 
        on the scores of the entire GRE testing population for the most recent 
        three-year period. These percentages are important in considering how an 
        applicant for admission to a particular management school compares with everyone 
        in the specified period, with all other applicants to the same school, and with 
        students already enrolled at the school.</p>

        Even though an &quot;I could have done better&quot; feeling is inevitable after any test, 
        taking the GRE Test again may not be helpful. Sometimes it is necessary to take 
        the GRE Test more than once, like when a management school asks you for more 
        recent scores than what you have. However, unless your scores seem unusually low 
        compared to your performance in the practice tests, or if you have not been able 
        to perform well because of a sudden illness or similar exceptional 
        circumstances, it’s advisable not to succumb to the temptation of repeating the 
        test. This is so for given the nature of the test, it is unlikely that your 
        scores can substantially improve, and in fact, your scores may decrease.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; ">
        If you repeat the test, your scores from the latest test date and the two most 
        recent test administrations in the last five years will be reported to the 
        institutions you designate as recipients. In any case, you cannot take the test 
        more than once in the same calendar month, even if you have taken the test and 
        cancelled your scores.</p>
